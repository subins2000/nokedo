# Nokedo

This was a project I made in 2013 to learn programming. Written in PHP, it's a network of sites like Google (and heavily inspired).

At the time I didn't know `git`, so source code was backuped into different folders. And the source code is pretty bad to look at. Hey! it was when I started learning programming and was 13 at the time. Forgive that kid.
